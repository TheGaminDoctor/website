                <p>CRASHBot is a Discord bot maintained and owned by Doc & Co, it was a passion project that ended up being semi-successful, we learned valuable information about Discord bots and how they function. The Bot is rarely online due to lack of use as well as it having to be run off our computers.</p>

                <p>RSMP was a server that was hosted and managed by Cdut which used Doc & Co developers to find issues with mods quickly so that the server would not have to face excessive downtime.</p>
